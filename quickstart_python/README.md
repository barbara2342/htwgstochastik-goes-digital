# Python files for quickstarting stochastic calculations for lectures "Stochastik" and "Mathematik 2" at HTWG Konstanz
- Run all files in this folder (1-5), understand them, play around with them and you should be familiar with some important features of Python
- this quickstart contains (yet) only basic data structures, calculations, plots and howto import a csv-file (provided in this folder)
- for more advanced examples and tutorials, see everywhere on the web.

## important note: these are script files! 
If you prefer working with Jupyter notebooks, you have to adapt the files!
