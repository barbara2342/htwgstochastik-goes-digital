# %% this starts a new cell

# ATTENTION: cell mode does not work in all IDEs. 
# At least it works in Spyder, in PyCharm and in VS Code
#
# using the script in cell mode does allow to not execute everything, but
# just the stuff in one cell (i.e. from one # %% just above the next # %%

# %% Variables
# Variables don't have a command to declare themVariables don't need a type when declaring them, 
# and you can reassign different types to the same variable. Â 

# Output
# In python to display data as a text you use print(). 
# Print always parses the values to a string representation if possible. 
# 

# Variables
age = 25
shoe_size = 42.5
eye_color = "braun"

# Print
print(age)
# Comma separated (concatenates  the string representation of the data, adding a space between each value)
print("age", age)

# Combined data. NOTE if you want to concatenate using + make sure that both values are of type string
print("eye color: " + eye_color)

# Formatted string (add an f before the string and add variables using {} )
print(f"side_job: {eye_color}")

print('\n') # prints an empy line


# %% Data types
# The most common types are int (whole number), float (decimal number), 
# string (text), boolean (true/false) and lists (array-like structures) 
# For a list of all built-in data types see: Python Data Types 

# Types

# Lists
#Lists have a wide range of operations see List operations
#The most notable difference to common temp_listays is the option to access parts of a list with slices 
#Lists are zero indexed.
