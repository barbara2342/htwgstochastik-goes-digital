## htwgstochastik-goes-digital
Code supporting my lectures "Stochastik" and "Mathematik 2" at HTWG Konstanz

### matlab 
contains the best code - MATLAB files used to creat the pictures in the lecture script

### python 
contains sometimes not so good code (todo) demonstrating how to realize some calculations done in the script

### quickstart_matlab
contains four MATLAB files for quickstarting stochastic calculations

### quickstart_python
contains five Python files and a csv files for quickstarting stochastic calculations

## Please note
The files contained in the quickstart directories are mere quick and dirty scripts suitable for understanding the basic functionalities of MATLAB and Python. For great tutorials and examples, ask your favourite search machine or have a look at the sources linked in the Moodle course.
