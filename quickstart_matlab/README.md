# MATLAB files for quickstarting stochastic calculations for lectures "Stochastik" and "Mathematik 2" at HTWG Konstanz
- Run all files in this folder (a-d), understand them, play around with them and you should be familiar with some important features of MATLAB
- this quickstart contains (yet) only basic data structures, calculations and plots
- for more advanced examples and tutorials, see everywhere on the web.

## important note: you need MATLAB and the stochastics toolbox
probably, the files work under Octave. No warranty, not tested.
